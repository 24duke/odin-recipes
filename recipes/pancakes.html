        <h1>What is a Pancake</h1>
        <p>Pancakes are a delightful breakfast staple cherished for their fluffy texture and versatile flavor. Made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder, pancakes are cooked on a griddle or skillet until golden brown. They offer a perfect canvas for a variety of toppings and fillings, from classic maple syrup and butter to fresh berries, whipped cream, or even chocolate chips. Whether enjoyed as a stack with a drizzle of honey or layered with fruit and yogurt, pancakes provide a warm and satisfying start to the day, combining comfort and culinary creativity in every bite. </p>
